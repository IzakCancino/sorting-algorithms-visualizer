# <h1 align="center">Sorting Algorithms Visualizer</h1>

**Visualize sorting algorithms being executed with different styles and configurations.**

Project made in C# with WPF.

## 📌 Characteristics

-   **🔩 Configuration:** Gives you the ability to select between different settings for the sorting execution, as the following ones: amount of numbers to sort, the color of the graphic, the sorting algorithm to be used (_also showing some info about it_), and the execution speed to make it go slower or faster.

    -   **🔢 Numbers to sort:** Select how many numbers you want in your graph.
    -   **🎨 Graphic color:** Choose the palette to use in the graph. The available options are `Green`, `Yellow`, `Blue`, and `B&W` (black and white).
    -   **🧮 Sorting algorithm:** Multiple options to select to use in the sorting of the graph. Each of them have different complexities that are shown below the selected one. The options to select are `Bubble sort`, `Selection sort`, `Insertion sort`, and `Merge sort`.
    -   **⏱ Sorting speed:** Select between different number that represent the delays used in the sorting. The options to select are `x0.1`, `x0.5`, `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `x4`, and `x5`. The decimal options make the algorithm to run slower, the `x1` option is the default, the greater than `x1` options make it go faster, and the option `x5` is real computer time without any delay.


- **🎮 Control buttons:** There are three buttons to use:
    - `Generate`: Fills the graph with bars with the selected configurations.
    - `Start`: Starts the execution of the selected algorithm in the speed selected.
    - `Cancel`: Stops the execution.

-   **📝 Log:** Also, you have the opportunity in another tab to watch each time a number reach its final position. In some algorithms, it gives information about how many steps took to reach that place.
